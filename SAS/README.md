# SASCourse - GitHub Organization Account
This privtae GitHub repository contains sample SAS programs that are used by the instructor to introduce SAS programming to students 
of STAT 4197/6197 at George Washington University. These programs center around topics that SAS language concepts, and 
a wide variety applications of Base SAS (DATA step, SAS procedures, ODS, DATA step debugger, and macro facility), SQL, and SAS/IML. 
In addition, some applications of the SASPy package using selected features of the Python language in JupyterLab platform are also introduced.

Stored in different weekly folders on the GitHub repo, the sample programs will supplement weekly class handouts that are posted to GW Blackboard. 
Students are encouraged to use these programs as practice exercises to enhance their comprehension of the materials.
